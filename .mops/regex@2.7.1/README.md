# Motoko Regex Engine
![regex1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8e7812-6dae-46e2-a167-c569a7fd4bd1)
A NFA based regular expression engine implemented in Motoko.

⚠️ **Note**: This project is newly released! There may still be undiscovered issues. Users are encouraged to report any bugs or provide feedback to help improve the engine.

## Installation

You can install the regex engine using [MOPS](https://mops.one/):

```bash
mops add regex
```

## Import

```motoko
import Regex "mo:regex";
```

## Usage Example

## Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the core components and data flow of the regex engine:

### Component Description

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Text Input: Raw regular expression string
   - External Cursor: Character-by-character stream processor

2. **Core Components**:
   - **Lexer**: Tokenizes the input stream into meaningful regex components
   - **Parser**: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens
   - **Compiler**: Transforms the AST into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)
   - **Matcher**: Executes pattern matching using the compiled NFA

3. **Intermediate Outputs**:
   - Tokens: Lexical units of the regex pattern
   - AST: Tree representation of the pattern structure
   - NFA: State machine for pattern matching
   - Match Result: Final output indicating match success/failure and captures
